//Project 2 Instanews

<body>
<p>I'm getting a clearer idea of how helpful GULP can be, and now more deeply understand how to create a good GULP file that will be applicable to projects moving forward.<p>

<p>I was having a hard time knowing where to start when it comes to writing out the Javascript and jQuery but this project helped me to think/draw out what i need to begin with and i'm getting a clearer idea of thinking my way through the steps. I was also able to acheive a few of the stretch goals this week!</p>

<p>This project also required more searching online for ways to solve my jQuery and Javascript issues and I think i'm getting better at narrowing down exactly what i'm looking for and understanding how to apply the fixes to my own code. I'm also less scared about trying different techniques, possibly breaking my code and having to work my way back, with my code in order to fix problems and reach the stretch goals.</p>

<p>I'm starting to understand flexbox better and don't require as much trial and error, visually drawing out my problems helps me and can minimize the amount of time i spend stuck on any one issue.</p>

<p>I enjoyed using the NYTimes api and i'm intrigued about what else you can do with api's.</p>
